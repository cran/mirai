Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 0.8.1
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution, local or distributed across
    the network. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an arbitrary
    expression asynchronously, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen), uses scalability protocols
    not subject to R connection limits and transports faster than TCP/IP where
    applicable.
