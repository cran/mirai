Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 0.7.1
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution, local or distributed across
    the network. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an arbitrary
    expression asynchronously, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) scalability protocols,
    defaults to the optimal choice of abstract sockets, Unix domain sockets or
    named pipes in addition to TCP/IP.
