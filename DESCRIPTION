Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 0.8.2
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution, local or distributed across
    the network. Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an arbitrary
    expression asynchronously, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Leverages 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) to provide efficient task
    scheduling, scalability beyond R connection limits, and transports faster
    than TCP/IP for inter-process communications.
