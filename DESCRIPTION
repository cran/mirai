Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network. Modern networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and
    'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen), ensures reliable and efficient scheduling
    over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.
    Distributed computing can launch remote resources via SSH or cluster
    managers. A queued architecture readily handles more tasks than
    available processes, requiring no storage on the file system.
    Innovative features include event-driven promises, asynchronous
    parallel map, and automatic serialization of otherwise non-exportable
    reference objects.
