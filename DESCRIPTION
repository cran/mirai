Description: Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression
    asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the
    network. Modern networking and concurrency, built on 'nanonext' and
    'NNG', ensures reliable scheduling over fast inter-process
    communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS. Launch remote resources via
    SSH or cluster managers for distributed computing. Scales efficiently
    to millions of tasks over thousands of connections, requiring no
    storage on the file system due to its inherently queued architecture.
    Innovative features include event-driven promises, asynchronous
    parallel map, and seamless serialization of otherwise non-exportable
    reference objects.
