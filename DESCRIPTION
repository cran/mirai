Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 0.12.0
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
    Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
    on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or secure TLS
    connections over TCP/IP, built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
