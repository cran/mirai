Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 0.11.0
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
    Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
    on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
    Features efficient task scheduling, fast inter-process communications, and
    Transport Layer Security over TCP/IP for remote connections, courtesy of
    'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen).
