Title: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Lightweight parallel code execution and distributed computing.
    Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously,
    on local or network resources, resolving automatically upon completion.
    State of the art networking and concurrency via 'nanonext' and 'NNG'
    (Nanomsg Next Gen) offers reliable and efficient scheduling over fast
    inter-process communications or TCP/IP secured by TLS.
