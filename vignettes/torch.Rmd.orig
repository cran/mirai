### Torch Integration

Custom serialization functions may be registered to handle external pointer type reference objects.

This allows tensors from the [`torch`](https://torch.mlverse.org/) package to be used seamlessly in 'mirai' computations.

#### Setup Steps

1. Register the serialization and unserialization functions as a list supplied to `serialization()`, specifying 'class' as 'torch_tensor' and 'vec' as TRUE.

2. Set up dameons - this may be done before or after setting `serialization()`.

3. Use `everywhere()` to make the `torch` package available on all daemons for convenience (optional).

```{r tensors}
library(mirai)
library(torch)

serialization(refhook = list(torch:::torch_serialize, torch::torch_load),
              class = "torch_tensor",
              vec = TRUE)
daemons(1)
everywhere(library(torch))
```
#### Example Usage

The below example creates a convolutional neural network using `torch::nn_module()`.

A set of model parameters is also specified.

The model specification and parameters are then passed to and initialized within a 'mirai'.

```{r tensors2}
model <- nn_module(
  initialize = function(in_size, out_size) {
    self$conv1 <- nn_conv2d(in_size, out_size, 5)
    self$conv2 <- nn_conv2d(in_size, out_size, 5)
  },
  forward = function(x) {
    x <- self$conv1(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x <- self$conv2(x)
    x <- nnf_relu(x)
    x
  }
)

params <- list(in_size = 1, out_size = 20)

m <- mirai(do.call(model, params), .args = list(model, params))

call_mirai(m)$data
```
The returned model is an object containing many tensor elements.
```{r tensors3}
m$data$parameters$conv1.weight
```
It is usual for model parameters to then be passed to an optimiser.

This can also be initialized within a 'mirai' process.
```{r tensors4}
optim <- mirai(optim_rmsprop(params = params), params = m$data$parameters)

call_mirai(optim)$data

daemons(0)
```
Above, tensors and complex objects containing tensors were passed seamlessly between host and daemon processes, in the same way as any other R object.

The custom serialization in `mirai` leverages R's own native 'refhook' mechanism to allow such completely transparent usage. Designed to be fast and efficient, data copies are minimised and the 'official' serialization methods from the `torch` package are used directly.
