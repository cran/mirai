### Parallel Integration

`mirai` provides an alternative communications backend for R. This functionality was developed to fulfil a request by R Core at R Project Sprint 2023.

`make_cluster()` creates a cluster object of class 'miraiCluster', which is fully-compatible with `parallel` cluster types.

  + Specify 'n' to launch nodes on the local machine.
  + Specify 'url' for receiving connections from remote nodes.
  + Optionally, specify 'remote' to launch remote daemons using a remote configuration generated by `remote_config()` or `ssh_config()`.

Created clusters may be used for any function in the `parallel` base package such as `parallel::clusterApply()` or `parallel::parLapply()`, or the load-balanced versions such as `parallel::parLapplyLB()`.
```{r cluster}
library(mirai)

cl <- make_cluster(4)
cl

parallel::parLapply(cl, iris, mean)
```
```{r sleep, echo=FALSE}
Sys.sleep(1L)
```
`status()` may be called on a 'miraiCluster` to query the number of connected nodes at any time.
```{r cluster2}
status(cl)

stop_cluster(cl)
```
Making a cluster specifying 'url' without 'remote' causes the shell commands for manual deployment of nodes to be printed to the console.
```{r cluster3}
cl <- make_cluster(n = 2, url = host_url())

stop_cluster(cl)
```
