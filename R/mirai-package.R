#' mirai: Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework for R
#'
#' Designed for simplicity, a 'mirai' evaluates an R expression asynchronously
#' in a parallel process, locally or distributed over the network, with the
#' result automatically available upon completion. Modern networking and
#' concurrency built on 'nanonext' and 'NNG' (Nanomsg Next Gen) ensure reliable
#' and efficient scheduling, over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP
#' secured by TLS. Advantages include being inherently queued thus handling many
#' more tasks than available processes, no storage on the file system, support
#' for otherwise non-exportable reference objects, an event-driven promises
#' implementation, and built-in asynchronous parallel map.
#'
#' @section Notes:
#'
#'  For local mirai requests, the default transport for inter-process
#'  communications is platform-dependent: abstract Unix domain sockets on Linux,
#'  Unix domain sockets on MacOS, Solaris and other POSIX platforms, and named
#'  pipes on Windows.
#'
#'  This may be overriden, if desired, by specifying 'url' in the
#'  \code{\link{daemons}} interface and launching daemons using
#'  \code{\link{launch_local}}.
