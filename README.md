### ミライ

<br /> みらい 未来 <br /><br /> Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework
for R <br /><br />

→ Run R code in parallel without blocking your session

→ Distribute workloads across local or remote machines

→ Perform actions reactively as soon as tasks complete

<br />

### Installation

``` r
install.packages("mirai")
```

### Quick Start

`mirai()` evaluates an R expression asynchronously in a parallel
process.

`daemons()` sets up persistent background processes for parallel
computations.

``` r
library(mirai)
daemons(5)

m <- mirai({
  Sys.sleep(1)
  100 + 42
})

mp <- mirai_map(1:9, \(x) {
  Sys.sleep(1)
  x^2
})

m
#> < mirai [] >
m[]
#> [1] 142

mp
#> < mirai map [4/9] >
mp[.flat]
#> [1]  1  4  9 16 25 36 49 64 81

daemons(0)
```

### Design Philosophy

→ **Modern Foundation**

- Architected on current communication technologies (IPC, TCP, secure
  TLS)
- Professional queueing and scheduling built on
  [nanonext](https://nanonext.r-lib.org/) and
  [NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org/)
- Engineered for custom serialization of cross-language data formats
  (e.g. torch, Arrow)

→ **Extreme Performance**

- Scales to millions of tasks across thousands of processes
- 1,000x greater efficiency and responsiveness than previously possible
- Zero-latency, event-driven promises brings modern async to R

→ **Production First**

- 100% reliable abstraction of the multi-process, message-passing
  paradigm
- Consistent and transparent evaluation, from minimal complexity and no
  hidden state
- Observability at scale through OpenTelemetry integration

→ **Deploy Everywhere**

- Deploy across local, remote (SSH), and HPC environments (Slurm, SGE,
  PBS, LSF)
- Combine and extend local processing power with network or cloud
  compute
- Direct tasks to the most suitable resources, using modular compute
  profiles

### Powers the R Ecosystem

mirai serves as a foundation for asynchronous, parallel and distributed
computing in the R ecosystem.

[Will Landau](https://github.com/wlandau/) for being instrumental in
shaping development of the package, from initiating the original request
for persistent daemons, through to orchestrating robustness testing for
the high performance computing requirements of crew and targets.

method to work seamlessly within Shiny, and prototyping event-driven
promises.

[Luke Tierney](https://github.com/ltierney/) of R Core, for discussion
on L’Ecuyer-CMRG streams to ensure statistical independence in parallel
processing, and reviewing mirai’s implementation as the first
‘alternative communications backend for R’.

[Travers Ching](https://github.com/traversc) for a novel idea in
extending the original custom serialization support in the package.
