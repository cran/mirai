Minimalist async evaluation framework for R.

Lightweight parallel code execution, local or distributed across the
network.

Designed for simplicity, a ‘mirai’ evaluates an arbitrary expression
asynchronously, resolving automatically upon completion.

Built on ‘nanonext’ and ‘NNG’ (Nanomsg Next Gen) scalability protocols,
defaults to the optimal choice of abstract sockets, Unix domain sockets
or named pipes in addition to TCP/IP.

`mirai()` returns a ‘mirai’ object immediately. ‘mirai’ (未来 みらい) is
Japanese for ‘future’.

The asynchronous ‘mirai’ task runs in an ephemeral or persistent
process, spawned locally or distributed across the network.

{mirai} has a tiny pure R code base, relying solely on {nanonext}, a
high-performance binding for the ‘NNG’ (Nanomsg Next Gen) C library with
zero package dependencies.

### Example 1: Compute-intensive Operations

Use case: minimise execution times by performing long-running tasks
concurrently in separate processes.

Multiple long computes (model fits etc.) can be performed in parallel on
available computing cores.

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate,
clean R process.

A ‘mirai’ object is returned immediately.

``` r
library(mirai)

m <- mirai({
  res <- rnorm(n) + m
  res / rev(res)
}, n = 1e8, m = runif(1))

m
#> < mirai >
#>  - $data for evaluated result
```

Above, all named objects are passed through to the mirai.

The ‘mirai’ yields an ‘unresolved’ logical NA value whilst the async
operation is ongoing.

``` r
m$data
#> 'unresolved' logi NA
```

Upon completion, the ‘mirai’ resolves automatically to the evaluated
result.

``` r
m$data |> str()
#>  num [1:100000000] -4.121 2.237 0.326 3.123 -4.802 ...
```

Alternatively, explicitly call and wait for the result using
`call_mirai()`.

``` r
call_mirai(m)$data |> str()
#>  num [1:100000000] -4.121 2.237 0.326 3.123 -4.802 ...
```

### Example 2: I/O-bound Operations

Use case: ensure execution flow of the main process is not blocked.

High-frequency real-time data cannot be written to file/database
synchronously without disrupting the execution flow.

Cache data in memory and use `mirai()` to perform periodic write
operations concurrently in a separate process.

A ‘mirai’ object is returned immediately.

Below, ‘.args’ accepts a list of objects already present in the calling
environment to be passed to the mirai.

``` r
library(mirai)

x <- rnorm(1e6)
file <- tempfile()

m <- mirai(write.csv(x, file = file), .args = list(x, file))
```

`unresolved()` may be used in control flow statements to perform actions
which depend on resolution of the ‘mirai’, both before and after.

This means there is no need to actually wait (block) for a ‘mirai’ to
resolve, as the example below demonstrates.

``` r
# unresolved() queries for resolution itself so no need to use it again within the while loop

while (unresolved(m)) {
  cat("while unresolved\n")
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
}
#> while unresolved
#> while unresolved

cat("Write complete:", is.null(m$data))
#> Write complete: TRUE
```

Now actions which depend on the resolution may be processed, for example
the next write.

### Daemons

Daemons or persistent background processes may be set to receive ‘mirai’
requests.

This is potentially more efficient as new processes no longer need to be
created on an *ad hoc* basis.

``` r
# create 8 daemons
daemons(8)
#> [1] 8

# view the number of active daemons
daemons("view")
#> [1] 8
```

The current implementation is low-level and ensures tasks are
evenly-distributed amongst daemons without actively managing a task
queue.

This robust and resource-light approach is particularly well-suited to
working with similar-length tasks, or where the number of concurrent
tasks typically does not exceed the number of available daemons.

``` r
# reset to zero
daemons(0)
#> [1] -8
```

Set the number of daemons to zero again to revert to the default
behaviour of creating a new background process for each ‘mirai’ request.

### Distributed Computing

Through the `daemons()` interface, tasks may also be sent for
computation to server processes on the network.

Specify the ‘.url’ argument as the client network address
e.g. ‘192.168.0.2’ and a port that is able to accept incoming
connections, or use ‘0.0.0.0’ to listen on all interfaces on the host,
for example:

``` r
daemons(.url = "tcp://0.0.0.0:5555")
#> [1] 1
```

The network topology is such that the client listens at the above
address, and distributes tasks to all connected server processes.

On the server side, the `server()` function may be called from an R
session, or Rscript from a suitable shell, to set up a remote daemon
process that connects to the client network IP address (‘192.168.0.2’ in
the example below):

    Rscript --vanilla -e 'mirai::server("tcp://192.168.0.2:5555")'

Network resources can be added and removed as required. Tasks are
automatically distributed to all available server processes.

To reset all connections and revert to default behaviour:

``` r
daemons(0)
#> Warning in daemons(0): 1 daemon shutdowns timed out (may require manual action)
#> [1] -1
```

Note: the above warning occurs as no server processes were actually
connected in creating this example.

### Deferred Evaluation Pipe

{mirai} implements a deferred evaluation pipe `%>>%` for working with
potentially unresolved values.

Pipe a mirai `$data` value forward into a function or series of
functions and it initially returns an ‘unresolvedExpr’.

The result may be queried at `$data`, which will return another
‘unresolvedExpr’ whilst unresolved. However when the original value
resolves, the ‘unresolvedExpr’ will simultaneously resolve into a
‘resolvedExpr’, for which the evaluated result will be available at
`$data`.

It is possible to use `unresolved()` around a ‘unresolvedExpr’ or its
`$data` element to test for resolution, as in the example below.

The pipe operator semantics are similar to R’s base pipe `|>`:

`x %>>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)` <br /> `x %>>% f()` is equivalent to
`f(x)` <br /> `x %>>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`

``` r
m <- mirai({Sys.sleep(0.5); 1})
b <- m$data %>>% c(2, 3) %>>% as.character()
b
#> < unresolvedExpr >
#>  - $data to query resolution
b$data
#> < unresolvedExpr >
#>  - $data to query resolution
Sys.sleep(1)
b$data
#> [1] "1" "2" "3"
b
#> < resolvedExpr: $data >
```

### Errors, Interrupts and Timeouts

If execution in a mirai fails, the error message is returned as a
character string of class ‘miraiError’ and ‘errorValue’ to facilitate
debugging. `is_mirai_error()` can be used to test for mirai execution
errors.

``` r
m1 <- mirai(stop("occurred with a custom message", call. = FALSE))
call_mirai(m1)$data
#> 'miraiError' chr Error: occurred with a custom message

m2 <- mirai(mirai())
call_mirai(m2)$data
#> 'miraiError' chr Error in mirai(): missing expression, perhaps wrap in {}?

is_mirai_error(m2$data)
#> [1] TRUE
is_error_value(m2$data)
#> [1] TRUE
```

If during a `call_mirai()` an interrupt e.g. ctrl+c is sent, the mirai
will resolve to an empty character string of class ‘miraiInterrupt’ and
‘errorValue’. `is_mirai_interrupt()` may be used to test for such
interrupts.

``` r
is_mirai_interrupt(m2$data)
#> [1] FALSE
```

If execution of a mirai surpasses the timeout set via the ‘.timeout’
argument, the mirai will resolve to an ‘errorValue’. This can, amongst
other things, guard against mirai processes that hang and never return.

``` r
m3 <- mirai(nanonext::msleep(1000), .timeout = 500)
call_mirai(m3)$data
#> 'errorValue' int 5 | Timed out

is_mirai_error(m3$data)
#> [1] FALSE
is_mirai_interrupt(m3$data)
#> [1] FALSE
is_error_value(m3$data)
#> [1] TRUE
```

`is_error_value()` tests for all mirai execution errors, user interrupts
and timeouts.
