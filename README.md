### „Éü„É©„Ç§

<br /> „Åø„Çâ„ÅÑ Êú™Êù• <br /><br /> Minimalist Async Evaluation Framework
for R <br /><br /> ‚Üí Designed for simplicity, a ‚Äòmirai‚Äô evaluates an R
expression asynchronously in a parallel process, locally or distributed
over the network.

‚Üí Modern networking and concurrency, built on
[nanonext](https://github.com/r-lib/nanonext/) and
[NNG](https://nng.nanomsg.org/) (Nanomsg Next Gen), ensures reliable and
efficient scheduling over fast inter-process communications or TCP/IP
secured by TLS. Distributed computing can launch remote resources via
SSH or cluster managers.

‚Üí A queued architecture readily handles more tasks than available
processes, requiring no storage on the file system. Innovative features
include event-driven promises, asynchronous parallel map, and automatic
serialization of otherwise non-exportable reference objects.
<br /><br />

### Quick Start

Use `mirai()` to evaluate an expression asynchronously in a separate,
clean R process.

The following mimics an expensive calculation that eventually returns a
vector of random values.

``` r
library(mirai)

m <- mirai({Sys.sleep(n); rnorm(n, mean)}, n = 5L, mean = 7)
```

> The mirai expression is evaluated in another process and hence must be
> self-contained, not referring to variables that do not already exist
> there. Above, the variables `n` and `mean` are passed as part of the
> `mirai()` call.

A ‚Äòmirai‚Äô object is returned immediately - creating a mirai never blocks
the session.

``` r
m
#> < mirai [] >
```

Whilst the async operation is ongoing, attempting to access a mirai‚Äôs
data yields an ‚Äòunresolved‚Äô logical NA.

``` r
m$data
#> 'unresolved' logi NA
```

To check whether a mirai remains unresolved (yet to complete):

``` r
unresolved(m)
#> [1] TRUE
```

To wait for and collect the return value, use the mirai‚Äôs `[]` method:

``` r
m[]
#> [1] 6.288799 7.337810 6.767335 7.435713 7.628763
```

As a mirai represents an async operation, it is never necessary to wait
for it. Once it completes, the return value is automatically available
at `$data`.

``` r
while (unresolved(m)) {
  # do work here that does not depend on `m`
}
m$data
#> [1] 6.288799 7.337810 6.767335 7.435713 7.628763
```

#### Daemons

üì°Ô∏èÔ∏è
[Daemons](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#local-daemons)
are persistent background processes for receiving mirai requests, and
are created as easily as:

``` r
daemons(6)
#> [1] 6
```

Daemons may also be deployed
[remotely](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#remote-daemons)
for distributed computing over the network.

üõ∞Ô∏èÔ∏è
[Launchers](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#launching-remote-daemons)
can start daemons via (tunnelled) SSH or a cluster resource manager.

üîê [Secure TLS
connections](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v1-daemons.html#tls-secure-connections)
can be used for remote daemon connections, with zero configuration
required.

#### Async Parallel Map

`mirai_map()` maps a function over a list or vector, with each element
processed in a separate parallel process. It also performs multiple map
over the rows of a dataframe or matrix.

``` r
df <- data.frame(
  fruit = c("melon", "grapes", "coconut"),
  price = c(3L, 5L, 2L)
)
m <- mirai_map(df, \(...) sprintf("%s: $%d", ...))
```

A ‚Äòmirai_map‚Äô object is returned immediately, and is always
non-blocking.

Its value may be retrieved at any time using its `[]` method to return a
list, just like `purrr::map()`. The `[]` method also provides options
for flatmap, early stopping and/or progress indicators.

``` r
m
#> < mirai map [3/3] >
m[.flat]
#> [1] "melon: $3"   "grapes: $5"  "coconut: $2"
```

> All errors are returned as ‚ÄòerrorValues‚Äô, facilitating recovery from
> partial failure. There are further
> [advantages](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v2-map.html) over
> alternative map implementations.

### Design Concepts

mirai is designed from the ground up to provide a production-grade
experience.

‚Üí Fast

- 1,000x more responsive vs.¬†common alternatives
  [<sup>\[1\]</sup>](https://github.com/r-lib/mirai/pull/142#issuecomment-2457589563)
- Built for low-latency applications e.g.¬†real time inference & Shiny
  apps

‚Üí Reliable

- No reliance on global options or variables for consistent behaviour
- Explicit evaluation for transparent and predictable results

‚Üí Scalable

- Launch millions of tasks over thousands of connections
- Proven track record for heavy-duty workloads in the life sciences
  industry

### Powering the Ecosystem

mirai features the following core integrations, with usage examples in
the linked vignettes:

[<img alt="R parallel" src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" width="40" height="31" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v5-parallel.html)
¬† Provides the first official alternative communications backend for R,
implementing a new parallel cluster type, a feature request by R-Core at
R Project Sprint 2023.

[<img alt="purrr" src="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://purrr.tidyverse.org)
¬† Powers the (in development) implementation of parallel map for the
purrr functional programming toolkit, one of the core tidyverse
packages.

¬† Implements the next generation of completely event-driven promises.
‚Äòmirai‚Äô and ‚Äòmirai_map‚Äô objects may be used interchangeably with
‚Äòpromises‚Äô, including with the promise pipe `%...>%`.

[<img alt="Shiny" src="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v3-promises.html)
¬† Asynchronous parallel / distributed backend, supporting the next level
of responsiveness and scalability within Shiny, with native support for
ExtendedTask.

[<img alt="Plumber" src="https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/images/logo-plumber.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v3-promises.html)
¬† Asynchronous parallel / distributed backend for scaling Plumber
applications in production.

[<img alt="torch" src="https://torch.mlverse.org/css/images/hex/torch.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v4-serialization.html)
¬† Allows Torch tensors and complex objects such as models and optimizers
to be used seamlessly across parallel processes.

[<img alt="Arrow" src="https://arrow.apache.org/img/arrow-logo_hex_black-txt_white-bg.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://mirai.r-lib.org/articles/v4-serialization.html)
¬† Allows queries using the Apache Arrow format to be handled seamlessly
over ADBC database connections hosted in background processes.

[<img alt="targets" src="https://github.com/ropensci/targets/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" width="40" height="46" />](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)
¬† Targets, a make-like pipeline tool, has adopted crew as its default
high-performance computing backend. Crew is a distributed
worker-launcher extending mirai to different distributed computing
platforms, from traditional clusters including LFS, PBS/TORQUE, SGE and
Slurm to cloud services such as AWS Batch.
